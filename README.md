# Address Book

## Created by Diego Rojas and Lara Bjork on November 5, 2019

### Project Description
This project was completed as part of the Epicodus in-class curriculum. The task description was as follows:

Follow along with the Address Book lessons to add the new concepts discussed in last night's homework. Complete these items for it too:

* Add functionality to record and display a contact's email address.
* Add functionality to record and display a contact's physical address.
* Then, add functionality that allows a user to record multiple addresses (email or physical) for a single Contact, and what type each address is (ie: "work", "personal", etc.) (Hint: Address will need to be an object with multiple properties saved within the Contact object.)
* Remove any additional address fields when the form is submitted. (One way to do this would be to use the not() and remove() functions.)


### Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 3.3.7, JavaScript, and jQuery v3.4.1 (uncompressed development version).
Project was written using Google Chrome; no other browsers were tested for compatibility.
